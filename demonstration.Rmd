## Purpose

Demonstrate:

1. the benefits of utilizing github as a file retention, collaboration, and version control toolset.

2. a quick How-To, to set up github and utilize it within RStudio.

Disclaimer:  This is only intended for familiarization purposes - github's functionality and use far exceeds what I'll be able to go over here.  I'm not affilidated with Github in any way.

## Why Use Github?

**Have you ever updated a file, and regretted it - wishing you could revert back to a previous version?** - I mash Ctrl+S continuously during file/document updates as a matter of course... but sometimes I wish I hadn't.

**Are your analysis files stored in a *less than easy to use and unintuitive*  C:/users/[username]/Documents folder, like a filing cabinet without folders?** Sometimes if one is just "doing this one thing quickly" and lax about keeping files rigorously organized you can really put yourself in a bind - if you have to then update it. 

**Do you have to pick up analysis from projects months, even years later - and have a hard time remembering where you were at in the process?**  Long term memory should be reserved for your important moments in life... project status shouldn't have to be something you need to keep track of...

## What does Github actually do? [www.github.com]

Github provides a **free** (with limitations) version control and collaboration system.  

Fetch - retrieve new work by others using the repo.

Merge - combine fetched work with your local work.

Pull - Fetch and Merge combined (run at the same time).

Push - Send local work to the repo.

Clone - clones a repo to your local computer. 

Every github repo has a unique URL - this exact project is here: https://github.com/unh-iod/CSTE_github_demonstration

## A quick aside - SAS can be run in RStudio

My personal preference is to use Github within the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE).  This isn't just for people using R as their prefered scripting language.

```{r}
library(SASmarkdown)
```

## Running SAS in RStudio

Example dataset from SAS from the sashelp library: class

```{sas}
proc means data=sashelp.class;
output out=temp;
run;

proc export data=temp
outfile="sas_data.csv"
dbms=csv
replace;
run;
```

## Passing data from SAS into R:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(flextable)

read.csv("sas_data.csv") %>% data.frame() %>% flextable()
```

## Where to start...?

Source: https://resources.github.com/github-and-rstudio/

1. Download and install [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)

2. Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). (1.1.383 or higher).

3. Create a remote repository on Github:

4. Copy the unique URL from github Code tab:

![https://github.com/unh-iod/CSTE_github_demonstration.git](repourl.png)

5. Open RStudio and create a new project `r "New Project > Version Control > Git"``:

![](newproject.png) > ![](versioncontrol.png) > ![](vcgit.png)

6. Paste the unique github repo URL and select a directory in which to create the R project:

![](Rproj.png)

7. This will create the folder and copy all contents of the github repo into the new local directory. This is a new repo and so only contains a .gitignore file (more on this later):

![](clonerepo.png)

## Adding files to the repo

1. Select `r "Git > Commit"`
